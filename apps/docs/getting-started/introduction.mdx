When your users need Word — not "Word-like" or "compatible" with — but actual DOCX documents with all their complexity, that is what we do.

SuperDoc brings Microsoft Word to the web.

## What We Built

We built a modern JS library for rendering and editing Word documents—complete with comments/tracked changes, complex tables, advanced pagination/headers, realtime collaboration, and and every Word feature users actually use. It was intention-built for advanced documents (e.g., legal contracts) and advanced document workflows and AI integrations.

## What Makes This Work

- **Real DOCX formatting, not rich text**: This isn't another contenteditable wrapper. SuperDoc handles actual `.docx` files with their full complexity.
- **Seamless integration**: Can be added to React, Vue, vanilla JS, or any modern framework. One API, zero lock-in.
- **Frontend and backend**: SuperDoc fully runs in the browser or in server-side Node, great for workflow automations and AI uses.
- **Highly extensible**: Completely customize the UX and add in your own features, plugins, commands, and nodes.
- **Dual licensed**: Available under AGPLv3 for community use and a Commercial License for enterprise deployments.

## 🤖️ AI Agents & LLMs

SuperDoc is designed from the ground up to work with Large Language Models. Every UI action is available programmatically via commands and helpers. Want your LLM to add tracked changes? No problem!
